 Slide No. 7 provides additional details about how to handle the data distribution across different tables based on the entry mode and voucher type. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

6.  Data Distribution Based on Entry Mode
Entry Mode Explanation:

The slide explains how data should be distributed between different tables (financial_trans and common_fee_collection) based on the entry mode or voucher type.
Entry modes such as DUE, SCHOLARSHIP, CONCESSION, etc., have specific purposes, and they determine where and how data is stored.
Red and Green Categorization:

The red-colored voucher types and amounts should be stored in the financial_trans (parent) and financial_tran_details (child) tables.
The green-colored voucher types and amounts should be stored in the common_fee_collection (parent) and common_fee_collection_headwise (child) tables.
